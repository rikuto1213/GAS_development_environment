# GAS Development Environment
This repository provides a streamlined development environment for Google Apps Script (GAS) projects using clasp and rollup. It is designed to facilitate local development, efficient bundling, and deployment to the GAS platform.

## Features
* Local Development: Write, edit, and organize your GAS scripts locally using modern development tools.
* Rollup Integration: Bundle your scripts efficiently, enabling the use of ES modules and other modern JavaScript features.
* TypeScript Support: Fully supports TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience.
* Clasp Deployment: Seamless deployment to Google Apps Script via the clasp CLI.
## Requirements
* Node.js (version 16 or later)
* clasp installed globally (npm install -g @google/clasp)
* Google account with access to Apps Script
## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GAS_development_environment.git
cd GAS_development_environment
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Authenticate with clasp:

```bash
clasp login
```

## Usage
### Local Development
1. Write your code in the src directory.
2. Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features as needed.
### Build and Deploy
1. Bundle your scripts with Rollup:

```bash
npm run build
```
This compiles and bundles your code into the dist directory.

2. Push your changes to Apps Script:

```bash
clasp push
```
Test your scripts in the Apps Script editor or directly in your project.

## Scripts
* npm run build: Bundles the code using Rollup.
* npm run deploy: Builds and deploys the code to Apps Script.
* clasp pull: Pulls the latest changes from Apps Script.
* clasp push: Pushes local changes to Apps Script.
